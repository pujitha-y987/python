# python
the assignments folder contain following programs
1. Create a dictionary with following tuples (1,2), (2,3), (3,4).
    (list_tuple_dict.py)
2. Take input as student marks (0,100) and return if the student is distinction or first class or second class or third class or fail (Marks>70 distinction, 70>marks>60 first class, 60>marks>50 second class, 50>marks>40 third class, marks<40 fail.
    (student_marks.py)
3. Create a list with 5 elements, then insert 2020 at index 2.
    (list_append)
4.  Print all 3 multiples from 1 to 100 using for loop.
    (multiples_3.py)
     using list comprehension 
     (mulwhile.py)  using while loop to print 3 multiples from 1 to 100
5.  List1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], reverse the list in single line code
    (reverse_list.py)
6. Create a tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6), then remove element 5 from it.
    (rmv_ele_tuple.py)
7. Write code create a list of even numbers (2 to 20) with list comprehension.
    (list_even2to20.py)
8. Create a list and remove last element from it.
      (list_lrmv.py)
9. Print all 3 multiples from 1 to 100 using for while loop.
      (mul3_forwhile.py)
10. You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers.

        The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:

        1: Sort based on name;

        2: Then sort based on age;

         3: Then sort by score.
         (sorting.py)
 11. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.

      The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
      (binary_div.py)
12.  Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys.The function should print all key/value combinations.
        (fun_dict_create.py)
13.  Write a program to find maximum between three numbers using conditional operator.
      (max3.py),(max 3.1.py),(max 3.2.py)
14.  Write a program to check whether year is leap year or not using conditional operator.
        (leap_year.py),(leap_year1.py)
15. Write a program to check whether character is an alphabet or not using conditional operator.
      (char_check.py), (char_check1.py), (char_check2.py)
