# You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers.

# The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:

# 1: Sort based on name;

# 2: Then sort based on age;

# 3: Then sort by score.

#The priority is that name > age > score.

#If the following tuples are given as input to the program:

#Tom,19,80

#John,20,90

#Jony,17,91

#Jony,17,93

#Json,21,85

#Then, the output of the program should be:

#[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
